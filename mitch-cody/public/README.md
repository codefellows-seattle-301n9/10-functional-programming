# Lab 10 Functional programming with cody and mitch

**Author**: Mitch Hall - Cody Green 
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This lab allowed us to invoke IFFE functions and use functional programming methods to modernize our code.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Clone the repo, install the packages from NPM while running node server using nodemon preferrably.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
HTML, CSS, node.js, PG, Express, Body-Parser, Javascript, Handlebars, JQUERY

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:
01-06-2018 9:00am - Mitch started driving forked the repo added collaborator setup the packages on his machine and installed dependencies copied starter folder and started on the first two functional programming functions.
01-06-2018 11:30am - Switched drivers from Mitch to Cody.
01-06-2018 11:31am-2:29pm - Cody Drove spent a lot of time on one problem but with the help of james managed to get the numWordsbyAuthor figured out by a lot of trial and error using the Functional Programming Methods map filter and reduce.
01-06-2018 2:30pm - Application now works per requirements of lab.
